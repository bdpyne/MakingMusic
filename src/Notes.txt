Goals
implement a basic type system
implement some functional behavior

Ideas
- make Whole, Half, Quarter notes into a type
- implement some music theory on top of Music
- make abstract Tone class that pitches extend

Functions
split: 
  - start with the signature Chord->Tones that splits by reading M or m to determine major/minor
  
zip: Tones x Durations->Phrase

Initial Idea
- generate code that has JMusic library calls for playing a small song
  Problem: it tended towards a lot of assignment statements with nothing else
           of interest
